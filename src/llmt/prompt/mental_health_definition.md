A healthcare business that provides mental and behavioral health care services to 
human patients is typically a specialized facility or organization, 
such as a mental health clinic, psychiatric hospital, or counseling center, 
that offers assessments, diagnoses, and evidence-based treatments for various 
mental health and behavioral disorders. 
These services may include individual and group therapy, 
psychiatric evaluations, medication management, and crisis intervention, 
delivered by a team of professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, 
licensed counselors, and social workers. 
The aim of such a business is to support patients in managing their conditions, 
improving their mental health and overall well-being, and fostering resilience and recovery 
in a compassionate and confidential environment.
